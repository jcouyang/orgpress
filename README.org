* TL;DR Why another Org Mode Blog Generator

** 1. This is a *really* *really simple* blog generator
so you can focus on writting

only thing you need to do is adding =org= or =markdown= files into =org= folder and =git push=, no more =C-c C-e P f=
** 2. You Don't need to learn EMACS...and Travis-ci will do all the job
just focus on writting, travis ci will take care of everything

* Configuration
there're few places you need to customize for you own blog

** Deploy Key
https://github.com/jcouyang/orgpress/orgpress/master/deploy.enc

this is my encrypted deploy key so you better generate your own.

here's how

1. =ssh-keygen=: 
 with name deploy or somthing you like, I named it deploy
2. =gem install travis=
3. =travis login=
4. =travis encrypt-file deploy --add=:
this will generate encrypted version of =deploy= file. Make sure not to add =deploy= to the git repository. only add =deploy.enc=. the option =--add= will add something like [[https://github.com/jcouyang/blog/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6][this]] to your =.travis.yml= file, which is the decrypt step running on travis ci, so make sure it's at least before =before_script= step
5. =cat deploy.pub | pbcopy=
6. open the github repo you wanna publish as github pages > Settings > Deploy keys
7.  =PASTE=
** =config.el=
fill your info

** Disqus, Google Analystics and Swiftype
